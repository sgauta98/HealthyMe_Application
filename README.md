# HealthyMe_Application

This is my current work in progress application that aims to output a combination of plant based foods that meet a full amino acid distribution given an input food. Many plant based foods are good sources of proteins but often lack a proper amino acid distribution and thus are referred to as "low quality proteins". This application will retrieve the amino acid distribution of the input food using a database and find a combination of plant based foods that optimize the amino acid distribution to be similar to "high quality proteins" such as meats.
